# JavaScript TDD Exercises

A repo of JavaScript TDD exercises, including ones done on the [JavaScript TDD Twitch stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xp2AXFXhxrg&list=PLXXnezSEtvNPFmEW5bN3YweiDDV16bnAm).

## Adding an Exercise

To create a new project folder, use [babelup](https://github.com/CodingItWrong/babelup):

```sh
$ babelup my-exercise-name
```

Then remove some files that aren't necessary because this is an exercise repo:

```sh
$ cd my-exercise-name
$ rm -fr .git .github
```

Edit the `README.md`, including removing the CI section.
