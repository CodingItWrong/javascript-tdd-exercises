# Roman Numerals - Jan 5, 2021 - JavaScript TDD Live Stream

Join me at 5 PM ET on [my Twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/codingitwrong)!

In last week's stream we started a classic TDD exercise on converting numbers to and from Roman numerals. This problem demonstrates the value of building the solution incrementally instead of trying to figure it all out from the start.

We made good progress, but there's a lot left to go, so we will continue where we left off on Jan 5! In the meantime, check out the repo to see the current state of the code, and feel free to try to continue the exercise from there.
