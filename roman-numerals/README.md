# Roman Numerals - Dec 29, 2020 and Jan 5, 2021 - JavaScript TDD Live Stream

In [part 1](https://youtu.be/0FphMcPlseo) we started a classic TDD exercise on converting numbers to and from Roman numerals. This problem demonstrates the value of building the solution incrementally instead of trying to figure it all out from the start.

In [part 2](https://youtu.be/eywQdC0tBcE), abstractions emerged that allowed us to handle cases up through 50. We got a little stuck on how to reduce duplication, but I figured it out after the stream.
